# 5stage-pipelined-MIPS32
This project implements a five-stage pipelined MIPS-32 processor using Verilog HDL.
It models the instruction flow through the classic stages :
Instruction Fetch (IF)
Instruction Decode (ID)
Execute (EX)
Memory Access (MEM)
Write Back (WB).

ðŸ“Œ Features
Five-stage pipeline architecture (IF â†’ ID â†’ EX â†’ MEM â†’ WB)

Instruction and data memory modules

Register bank with 32 registers

Branch prediction with branch decision logic

ALU with support for:

Arithmetic: ADD, SUB, MUL, ADDI, SUBI

Logical: AND, OR

Comparison: SLT, SLTI

Load and store support: LW, SW

Branch instructions: BEQZ, BNEQZ

Immediate value extension and instruction decoding

HALT instruction to stop execution

Pipeline register forwarding across all stages
